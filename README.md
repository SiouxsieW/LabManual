# LabManual

This repository contains the lab manual for people working in the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland, in Aotearoa New Zealand. The Principal Investigator of the lab is Associate Professor Siouxsie Wiles.

It is intended that the lab manual will be divided into 4 parts:
  Part 1 details the lab values and the roles and expectations for lab members
  Part 2 details the biological safety requirements and information on each of the bacterial species we work on in the lab
  Part 3 details processes and procedures for gaining entry to the lab and initial training
  Part 4 details the processes and procedures to enable the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab to transition to being an open science lab

A GoogleDoc version of Part 1 of the lab manual is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BGRwNQnB-wfU9hCp2HoWwH5zpCV3_WtHeMq9Ve60NY/edit?usp=sharing
